        "description": "AccessHealth Spartanburg (AHS), part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.strategicspartanburg.org\/public-health\/\">Road to Better Health initiative<\/a>,\u00a0is a local non-profit organization affiliated with Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System (SRHS). AHS\u00a0serves uninsured, low-income (at or below 150% Federal Poverty Level) residents of Spartanburg County by connecting them to medical and behavioral health care, as well as an array of social services and programs to address barriers to health and a healthy lifestyle. The 10 original partners who helped create this model include: Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System, Mary Black Health System (MBHS), Spartanburg Area Department of Mental Health, The Forrester Center for Behavioral Health, Spartanburg County Medical Society, St Luke\u2019s Free medical Clinic, ReGenesis Health Care, Welvista, DHEC, and USC-Upstate. Dozens of other local programs and services have become partners since. The program receives grant funding from The Duke Endowment, United Way of the Piedmont, Spartanburg Regional Foundation, and others - and has recently been awarded funding\u00a0from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. SRHS provides more than $180,000 of in-kind support annually. In 2013 SRHS and MBHS committed to fund an intensive case management model through AHS with a combined fund of $1 million annually.\r\n\r\nAccessHealth Spartanburg has established a network of local physicians and other healthcare providers to address the needs of uninsured people in our community. Unlike a clinic,\u00a0patients in the\u00a0network visit doctors throughout the community at their regular offices. We aim to create a system in which patients receive consistent, ongoing care, and physicians are able to treat patients in the most convenient and efficient way possible. Collaboration is the core of the AccessHealth model, and AHS receives referrals from the emergency department, inpatient discharge planners, case managers, and other hospital programs and departments. AHS also partners with a host of\u00a0\u00a0community organizations, including:\u00a0Department of Mental Health, St Luke\u2019s Free Clinic, Emerge Family Therapy, Spartanburg Vocational Rehabilitation, Adult Learning Center, Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Spartanburg County Detention Center and many others.\r\n\r\nAHS continues to see a marked reduction in hospital utilization for ambulatory conditions by patients enrolled in the\u00a0program. The program has enrolled more than 7,000 individuals to date, and nearly 2,000 individuals have \u201cgraduated\u201d the program (they have obtained insurance or their income has risen above the threshold to be eligible for AHS). There has also been reductions in A1C and blood pressure for many clients. The Duke Endowment estimates a return\u00a0on investment of $12.62 for every $1 invested in the program. Notably, SRHS charity care has decreased from $116 million in 2009 to $68 million in 2016.",

        "description": "The Better Health Through Housing pilot grew out of an\u00a0awareness by UI Health leadership that in order to realize its Health Equity mission, they need to take on the challenge of improving the health of whole communities on the west and south sides of Chicago. UI Health is located about 2 miles from downtown Chicago on the near Westside, in the Illinois Medical District, in one of the highest concentrations of city homelessness. With six other nearby hospitals, the chronically homeless hop from one Emergency Department (ED) to another. The goals of their program are: to create a healthcare-to-housing pilot using the Housing First model; to evaluate the effect of housing on health outcomes, cost, and utilization (this includes studying homelessness as a heath condition); and to promote and advocate for more healthcare-to-housing programs in the Chicago area using a collective impact approach\r\n\r\nUI Health pays their partner, the Center for Housing &amp; Health (CHH) $1,000 per member per month. CHH created a housing collaborative consisting of over twenty housing agencies that manage 125-150 one-bedroom apartments scattered throughout the city, as well as three single room occupancy (SRO) facilities that serve as bridge units until permanent supportive housing is located. The agencies work with individual landlords that accept and tolerate patients with mental illness and\/or substance abuse. There are two program staff: The Program Director and a Care Coordinator, a licensed clinical social worker who specializes working with the homeless. UI\u00a0forecasts this will provide housing for between 20-30 chronically homeless patients for a year (last year\u2019s program referred 27 homeless individuals).\u00a0Identification and referral of homeless patients takes a considerable amount of care coordination, not only internally but with community-based partners. In order to strike a balance between healthcare utilization and medical vulnerability, the program utilizes a \u201cTumor Board\u201d multidisciplinary team consisting of ED, oncology and psychiatry social workers, ED and psychiatry attending physicians, as well as a CHH program coordinator and an Outreach Worker who locates the patients on the street once they are referred into the program.\u00a0The program consists of $250,000 of internal annual funding (a combination of both operational and philanthropic dollars).\r\n\r\nAs a result of the program internal healthcare costs have come down 21% (removing one patient in end-of-life care and the reduction is 67%), ED utilization is down 45% and inpatient admissions have been reduced by 55%. UI Health\u00a0has also begun identifying the homeless in their\u00a0patient population, and since 2008 have found over 1,300 homeless patients.",

To achieve this, the program has three main components.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Prevention: engaging youth early in long-term mentorship and developmental activities to divert them from involvement with violent peer groups and behaviors.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Community Mobilization: engaging with concerned organizations and neighborhood residents to build community strategies to reduce neighborhood violence.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Intervention: immediately engaging with people who have been violently injured to prevent retaliation and provide counsel and support.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nNYC H+H works with many partners on GDLU, including local schools, Cure Violence programs across the city, the Bronx Documentary Center, and other local vendors and community-based organizations to share resources and activities.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

HYT helps youth and young adults age 15 to 22 who are aging out of foster care make the transition to independent living.\r\n\r\nThe program structure is provided by Memorial Life Coaches, who develop rapport and engage youth in an open, honest professional relationship in order to assist them with successful transition to an acceptable, responsible, productive adulthood. Typically, the youth distrust the very systems they have relied on as they have been disappointed frequently by foster care agency staff turnover, lack of services, frequent group home relocations (several youth served have been in over 20 homes in the 10-12 years they have been in foster care) and being separated with the siblings. By building a safe and nurturing relationship, HYT youth being to realize that the Memorial staff are here to help them grow, mature and develop into the adults they desire to become but did not have the role models or consistent caring adults in their lives. The Life Coach aims to help each participant gain skills and self-sufficiency to navigate the logistics of daily living, health management, social relationships, education, employment and money management, and other aspects of young adulthood.\r\n\r\nAll of Memorial Healthcare System's Community programs and initiatives are rooted in collaborative partnerships that work to strengthen families and communities. HYT involves internal collaboration, with partnership from the primary care, specialty services, and behavioral health departments. External community partners include local universities, food banks, legal service providers, and the sheriff's office.\r\n\r\nCurrent outcome measures of the program found that 96% of the females have had no new pregnancies, 98% of all youth have had no new law violations, 98% demonstrated proficiency in employability and\/or job retention skills, 86% made progress in school, were promoted, graduated, or obtained a GED, and 89% have obtained stable housing.",

The other clinical areas were gradually added over a five-year period. It now serves patients from all departments at BMC who have a physician\u2019s referral, a prescription for supplemental food that best promote physical health, prevent future illness, and facilitate recovery.\r\n\r\nStriving solely on philanthropy, the Food Pantry provides food to approximately 7,000 people per month. It is open Monday to Friday from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, and families can visit twice per month. They receive three to four days\u2019 worth of food each visit, based on their household sizes and dietary restrictions. A key feature is the provision of perishable foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, meats, milk, cheese and eggs \u2013 items that are costly and therefore often lacking in a low-income family\u2019s diet.\r\n\r\nThe Pantry works closely with the Greater Boston Food Bank, receiving an average of 15,000 pounds of food each week. It also benefits from partnerships with companies, local schools, churches and temples that donate food.\r\n\r\nRecipient of the 2012 James W.
